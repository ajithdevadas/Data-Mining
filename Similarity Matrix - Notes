1. Which two cars are most similar?

The dataset is car evaluation data with multivariate categorical attributes. They are as follows:
Attributes:

1. buying: vhigh, high, med, low.
2. maint: vhigh, high, med, low.
3. doors: 2, 3, 4, 5more.
4. persons: 2, 4, more.
5. lug_boot: small, med, big.
6. safety: low, med, high.
7. Class value: unacc, acc, good, vgood

All of these attributes can be treated as ordinal as they have a meaningful order or ranking even
though the magnitude between successive values is unknown.

To find the most similar cars we must calculate the dissimilarity matrix for the above data set, find
the lowest value in the matrix and find the matrix locations where the values can be seen .

Below steps are followed:

1. Rank the values for each attribute
For eg : buying can take any of the 4 values vhigh,high,med and low.
Here range = 4
Rank each value according to their order: vhigh = 1, high=2, med=3 and low=4.

2. Perform data normalization (Interval-Scaling) for each attribute value
Eg: normalized values for buying attribute
vhigh = (rank – 1) / (range - 1)
vhigh = (1-1) / (4-1) = 0.
Similarly, high = (2-1) / (4-1) = 1/3 = 0.3333333

3. Using dist function in R, compute the dissimilarity matrix. The dissimilarity matrix will
contain Euclidean distance values.

4. Take unique values from the matrix as the matrix is symmetric about its diagonal

5. Sort (and save) the resulting set to find the min value from the matrix ( which corresponds
to highest similarity). The Min value is Zero and upon checking it has been determined that
the resultant pairs constitute the diagonal of the dissimilarity matrix. The next min value (min
non-zero value; which is 0.333333) is fetched to find the similar pairs.

6. In the dissimilarity matrix there are 4520 matches found with value = 0.3333333 which
means that 2260 pairs have the most similarity.

7. The most similar pairs (2260 pairs) can be seen in the output file “Question1-
SimilarCars.csv”. [Values are not copied over here as the number of records is high.]

2. Which two cars are most dissimilar?

From the sorted data (#1.5) find the max value. This corresponds to highest dissimilarity.
The max value is 2.645751
In the given data set below pairs are the most dissimilar ones as the cells [1, 1728] & [82,
1647] have value = 2.645751.

1. Cars 1 & 1728

2. Cars 82 & 1647

The most similar pairs (2 pairs) can be seen in the output file “Question2-
DissimilarCars.csv”.

3. Find the two categorical attributes that have the highest
positive/negative correlation. Draw a scatter plot of these two
attributes.

Using the interval scaled dataset calculated from #1.2, derive the correlation matrix using
COR function in R.

The maximum correlation value found in the matrix is 1 which constitutes the diagonal cells
in the matrix. There are no cells other than the diagonal cells having correlation = 1.
The second highest correlation value (0.4393373) is found and the corresponding cells are
determined.

The cells determined are (6,7). Hence the columns V6 (Safety) and V7 (Class Values) are
having the highest positive correlation, with a correlation coefficient of 0. 4393373.

None of the attributes have negative correlation.

The columns having highest correlation can be seen in the output file “Question3-
HighlyCorrelatedAttributes.csv”

Here is the scatter plot of ‘Safety’ and ‘Class Values’.

4. Present the dissimilarity matrix for the very good cars.

A subset of the interval scaled dataset calculated from #1.2 is derived by filtering all records that
are not having Class Value = vgood.

Using dist function in R, compute the dissimilarity matrix. The dissimilarity matrix will contain
Euclidean distance values.

The dissimilarity matrix of very good cars can be seen in the output file “Question4-
DissimiarityMatrix.csv”. [Values are not copied over here as the number of records is high.]
